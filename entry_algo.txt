Pseudocode for entry of new people in given number of gates

N- Number of gates
arr - array storing number of people in each gate

min = arr[0]
index

i=1
while(i<N)
   if arr[i]<min
      min = arr[i]
   Endif
   i=i+1
Endwhile
i=0
while(i<N)
   if arr[i]==min
      index.push_back(i)
   Endif
   i=i+1
Endwhile
print "You can enter to following gate number: "
i=0
while(i<index.size())
   print index[i]+1
   if i!=index.size()-1
      print ","
   else
      print " "
   Endif
   i=i+1
Endwhile
print "\n"

t
if index.size()>1
   print "You want to enter in which gate: "
   scan t
   arr[t-1]=arr[t-1]+1
else
   arr[index[0]]=arr[index[0]]+1
